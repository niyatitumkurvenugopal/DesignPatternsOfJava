/*
A Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern.

Proxy design patterns can be used for control access.
It can be said that it will provide security between client and server.

For example if we want to give the delete option to only admin users.
So if non-admin try to delete something the proxy will check if the non-admin has the access to delete it.
If not then it will show an error and if admin tries to delete,
 he will be able to delete as in proxy it will be having access.

Another example,We can say that a credit card is a proxy .This can be used instead of cash.

/*

Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern.

Adapter design pattern is used to join 2 interfaces, i.e it can be said that the object will have the same features but different interfaces.

It allows existing classes to be used with others without modifying the source code.

For example a charging adapter ( this charging adapter will join 2 interfaces) or a WebDriver adapter.
In this example the chromeDriver is implemented by WebDriver.In this WebDriverAdapter is the adapter and the ieDriver is the adaptee.

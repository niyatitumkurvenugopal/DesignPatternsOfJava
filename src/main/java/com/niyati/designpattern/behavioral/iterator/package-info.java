/*
The Iterator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern .

It can be used to get the elements of a collection object in a sequential manner.

The Iterator design pattern contains an iterator interface which will have a navigation method i.e to go to the next element or to know whether the next element exists or not.Iterator design pattern also contains a container interface which will return an iterator and the concrete class i.e NameRepository will implements the container and it is responsible to implement NameIterator.

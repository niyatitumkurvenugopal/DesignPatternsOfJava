/*
Template design pattern is used when we have some fixed functions which every class must follow.

For example base class House which will be having a template called buildHouse(),
it contains all steps of building a house.
In base house fixed steps like constructBase() and constructRoof() functions will be present.
Other functions can be changed with the help of derived class.

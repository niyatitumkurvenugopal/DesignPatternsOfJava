/*
In Visitor design pattern we can add new behaviors to existing class without altering the code.
In this there is 2 methods accept() and visit().
In this accept() method will accept the visit if there is a visitor and visit() method will be called
whenever there is a visit.

For example,Uber taxi,that is in this an employee calls an uber taxi to his door step.
The Uber taxi visitor is in charge of transportation for that person after the person sits in.

/*
Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms ,put each of them into a separate class and make them interchangeable.
The strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.
For good coding we need to abstract out which is different.
That is make a different class and put just those things that are different inside the subclasses.
